### Observations
1. Lack of direction from HQ
2. Event scheduling doesn't allow enough time for others to plan.
2. Lost time
    - June & July could have been used to mentor early candidates
    - Time could have been used to prepare social media presence
        - Creating YouTube videos for later release
        - Composing tweets & other social media posts
2. Local EDAs approach could be better-organized
    - Most meetings & events scheduled with two days notice
2. Obstacles
    - Regional Co-ordinators (ie. [Nicola Hanson][1])
    - Blocked at national debates
    - Lack of training & support
        - [NationBuilder][12] software
        - Importance of visibility & engagement with public on social media
2. Harassment of PPC Supporters
    - [#ppcPurge2019][6] team, led by [Shawn Paul Melville][2]
    - [Manny Montegrino][3], former lawyer for PM Harper, frequent guest on [Rebel News Online][7]
2. Misinformation
    - CPC hired Warren Kinsella's Daisy Group [article][10]
    - Polls (related to above?)
2. Stronger presence on social media was possible
	- The Facebook page I managed was active and received some large donations
	- Commenting on Max's FB posts generated a lot of traffic to the candidate's page
	- Not many other candidates seemed to engage with Max's FB page

### Social Media Support
(ie. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube)
1. **PPC Retweets** began as a research project of mine, with the following objectives:
	- To combat Twitter shadow-banning of PPC-related tweets
	- To aggregate PPC-related tweets from PPC supporters and candidates
	- To maintain a list of the Twitter accounts followed by Max, to make it easier for people to follow & retweet each other.
2. I inherited **SupportersOfPPC** in September, and repurposed it to retweet PPC candidates, and continue its presence.
2. The **Hashtag Team** was created to help get Max into the debates
	- Several hashtag campaigns managed to get a variety of Twitter hashtags trending, in order to get attention, espcially that of the Leaders' Debate Commissioner and the Munk debate.
	- After the debates, campaigns help to promote the PPC platform
	- About 500 people were involved in this, managed by Sharon (@mmccdenier)
2. There were several YouTube channels posting PPC material, but no way to easily find them
	- A method of aggregating video posts could help
		- Sharing videos on a dedicated PPC channel could achieve this
		- (Even a playlist or playlists on a dedicated PPC channel would help)
		- Content creators could use a Create Commons licence when posting videos to be shared

### Lean Manufacturing / Agile Philosophy
Lean Manufacturing is about minimizing waste.  Said another way, lean means
creating more value for customers with fewer resources, and these principles
can be applied to most ventures/organizations.

Agile is the ability to create and respond to change. It is a way of dealing with,
and ultimately succeeding in, an uncertain and turbulent environment.

The authors of the Agile Manifesto chose “Agile” as the label for this whole idea
because that word represented the adaptiveness and response to change which was so
important to their approach.

It’s really about thinking through how you can understand what’s going on in the
environment that you’re in today, identify what uncertainty you’re facing, and
figure out how you can adapt to that as you go along.

### Regular Communications with HQ
1. Twitter chat rooms filled the need to share information between EDAs & candidates
2. A Slack channel was created, but not everbody migrated
2. A mailing list or discussion group could help
	- NationBuiler may also offer forums

### More Engagement between Max & Candidates on Social Media
1. More activity on YouTube and other video sharing platforms
2. HQ needs a repository / channels for sharing candidate videos
2. Candidates & EDA need to be more visible on Max's posts / videos

### No Friends in Broadcast Media
1. Related to KinsellaGate
2. Need to build stronger presence on video platforms like YouTube, BitChute, and Periscope
	- Periscope videos typically have a 48-hour lifespan
2. HQ amplifies Facebook events; the same could be done for YouTube videos

### Outreach
1. College & university campuses and student organizations
2. Pro-freedom groups (ie. gun rights)

### Shared Services
This is in the interests of reducting duplication of expenses.  Areas of interest
include internet services and promtional materials.  This is core to offering more
of a "turn-key" solution.

**Vision:** People setting up the EDAs log on to *peoplespartyofcanada.ca*, enter EDA
details into a form, and a web page with donation button, Email address, chat room
are created.  As candidates are recruited, the EDA can log on to enter the candidate's
name, and have a web page & Email address created.
- People should be able to enter *<ridingname>.peoplespartyofcanada.ca* or
*peoplespartyofcanada/<ridingname>* to find their riding and a similar scheme to find
their candidate.
- Candidates sholuld be able to log on to find vendors for business cards and signage
from regional and national businesses that offer discounts, arranged by HQ.

#### Internet - peoplespartyofcanada.ca
1. Everybody has a peoplespartyofcanada.ca Email address
2. EDA sub-sites for [NationBuilder][12] (if possible)

#### Promotional Materials
Business cards & signs on HQ site for discounted price

### Combatting Polls & Misinformation
1. Public events need to be held at large venues, like SkyDome
	- This is important to combat perceptions from fake polls
2. Could be joint event, where PPC has blocks of seats
2. The public needs to see there are more people than the polls lead them to believe
