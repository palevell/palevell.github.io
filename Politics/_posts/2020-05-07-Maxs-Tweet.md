I got my tweet from Maxime Bernier!  It's going to take me a while to read through the replies . . .

For those unfamiliar with Max, he is the leader of a new political party in Canada, called the People's Party (PPC).

He left the Conservatives when they shafted him in the leadership race, back in 2017.  When asked, he said he left because the party is intellectually and morally corrupt.

At the end of the race, there were 7,000 more ballots cast than members, and they were destroyed shortly afterwards.  An audit was never done.

During last year's election, Max was the only party leader to speak-out against the UN and high immigration numbers.

They made sure Max didn't win.  I know of at least two PPC candidates who saw their vote totals DROP as the election returns were being reported.

During the election, Max asked his followers to RT and follow each other.  That's a big job, so I created a list for people to follow, and a bot to retweet his followers.  We domionated social media.  By my estimation, we had 5x the support of any of the other parties.

Hopefully, this will help get my Twitter accounts back online. (Feel free to RT)
