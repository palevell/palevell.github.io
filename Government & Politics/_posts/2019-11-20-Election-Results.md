Based on the YouTube video statisics of the party leaders' media scrums, 
Maxime Bernier was the clear favourite--he had the most views & engagement,
and highest approval rating.  Andrew Scheer was a distant second, with 
less than 25% of Bernier's engagement, and an approval rating of 50%. 

This election appeared to be a race between Maxime Bernier and Andrew 
Scheer, but that isn't what happened.

What do you think these numbers are telling us?
