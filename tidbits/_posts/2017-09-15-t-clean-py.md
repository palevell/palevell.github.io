When I was active in the Bitcoin community, I experienced a surge in [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/palevell) followers with foreign languages.  After that, I decided to stop using a [cron job](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/define-cron-crond-and-cron-jobs/) for a [Twitter command line interface](https://sferik.github.io/t/) to automatically follow users back.

Since then, I have been trying to figure out a way to identify foreign-looking tweets and unfollow the twits/tweeps who post them.  (Twitter users are commonly referred to as twits or tweeps).  I have several Twitter accounts, so the cleanup process was sure to be time-consuming.

To my knowledge, Twitter doesn't provide language information about tweets.  Recently, I became aware of [Python's language detection module](https://github.com/Mimino666/langdetect), and I knew I had discovered a solution.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/palevell/9614f01f21bebefe5b1cfdb745c02105.js"></script>

**Note:** This script requires a [Python](https://www.python.org/) module I wrote, called [pylocalnow](https://palevell.github.io/pylocalnow). 

On the first run, this script identified nearly 100 Twitter accounts to be unfollowed.  As I improve the logic for identifying tweets that look like gobbledy-gook, this single file is likely to evolve into a full-blown Python package.

Enjoy!
