# Get Your Free Idle Tweeps Report

If the tweeps you follow become inactive, they can affect 
the algorithms Twitter uses to get your tweets seen by others.
As part of good account housekeeping practices, it is a good idea 
to periodically unfollow accounts that become inactive.

Also, Twitter has limits on how many followers you can have.  
A common barrier is at 5,000 followers.  Twitter expects you to 
have a certain follower:following ratio, and if you hit 5,000 
tweeps you follow and Twitter decides you don't have enough 
followers, it won't let you follow more people.

One way to follow more people and avoid the 5,000 limit is to 
unfollow inactive accounts.

This is where I can help.

I wrote a program that will identify the accounts you follow that 
haven't tweeted in the last six (6) months.

As a public service, I am offering a free "Idle Tweeps Report" to 
the first 10 people who respond to this offer.
