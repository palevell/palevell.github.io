**Next Steps**

### Observations
- Lack of direction from HQ
- Event scheduling doesn't allow enough time for others to plan.
- Lost time
    - June & July could have been used to mentor early candidates
    - Time could have been used to prepare social media presence
        - Creating YouTube videos for later release
        - Composing tweets & other social media posts
- Local EDA's approach was largely half-assed
    - Most meetings & events scheduled
- Obstacles
    - Regional Co-ordinators (ie. [Nicola Hanson][1])
    - Blocked at national debates
    - Lack of training & support
        - NationBuilder software
- Harassment of PPC Supporters
    - [#ppcPurge2019][6] team, led by [Shawn Paul Melville][2]
    - [Manny Montegrino][3], former lawyer for PM Harper, frequent guest on [Rebel News Online][7]
- Misinformation
    - CPC hired Warren Kinsella's Daisy Group


### Lean Manufacturing / Agile Programming Philosophy
Lean Manufacturing is about minimizing waste.  Said another way, lean means creating more value for customers with fewer resources, and these principles can be applied to most ventures/organizations.

### Regular Communications from HQ

### More Engagement between Max & Candidates on Social Media
- More activity on YouTube and other video sharing platforms

- Everybody has a peoplespartyofcanada.ca Email address
- EDA sub-sites for NationBuilder (if possible)
-

### No Friends in the Media
