### Observations
- Lack of direction from HQ
- Event scheduling doesn't allow enough time for others to plan.
- Lost time
    - June & July could have been used to mentor early candidates
    - Time could have been used to prepare social media presence
        - Creating YouTube videos for later release
        - Composing tweets & other social media posts
- Local EDAs approach could be better-organized
    - Most meetings & events scheduled with two days notice
- Obstacles
    - Regional Co-ordinators (ie. [Nicola Hanson][1])
    - Blocked at national debates
    - Lack of training & support
        - NationBuilder software
- Harassment of PPC Supporters
    - [#ppcPurge2019][6] team, led by [Shawn Paul Melville][2]
    - [Manny Montegrino][3], former lawyer for PM Harper, frequent guest on [Rebel News Online][7]
- Misinformation
    - CPC hired Warren Kinsella's Daisy Group [article][10]
- Stronger presence on social media was possible
	- The Facebook page I managed was active and received some large donations
	- Commenting on Max's FB posts generated a lot of traffic to the candidate's page
	- Not many other candidates seemed to engage with Max's FB page

### Social Media Support (ie. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube)
- **PPC Retweets** began as a research project of mine, with the following objectives:
	- To combat Twitter shadow-banning of PPC-related tweets
	- To aggregate PPC-related tweets from PPC supporters and candidates
	- To maintain a list of the Twitter accounts followed by Max, to make it easier for people to follow & retweet each other.
- I inherited **SupportersOfPPC** in September, and repurposed it to retweet PPC candidates, and continue the presence.
- The **Hashtag Team** was craeted to help get Max into the debates
	- Several hashtag campaigns managed to get a variety of Twitter hashtags trending, in order to get attention, espcially that of the Leaders' Debate Commissioner and the Munk debate.
	- After the debates, campaigns help to promote the PPC platform
	- About 500 people were involved in this, managed by Sharon (@mmccdenier)
- There were several YouTube channels posting PPC material, but no way to easily find them
	- A method of aggregating video posts could help
		- Sharing videos on a dedicated PPC channel could achieve this
		- (Even a playlist or playlists on a dedicated PPC channel would help)
		- Content creators could use a Create Commons licence when posting videos to be shared

### Lean Manufacturing / Agile Programming Philosophy
Lean Manufacturing is about minimizing waste.  Said another way, lean means
creating more value for customers with fewer resources, and these principles
can be applied to most ventures/organizations.

- [What Is Lean Manufacturing?][8]
- [What is Lean?][9]

### Regular Communications with HQ
- Twitter chat rooms filled the need to share information between EDAs & candidates
- A Slack channel was created, but not everbody migrated
- A mailing list or discussion group could help

### More Engagement between Max & Candidates on Social Media
- More activity on YouTube and other video sharing platforms
- HQ needs a repository / channels for sharing candidate videos
- Candidates & EDA need to be more visible on Max's posts / videos

### No Friends in Broadcast Media
- Related to KinsellaGate
- Net to build stronger presence on video platforms like YouTube
- HQ amplifies Facebook events; the same could be done for YouTube videos

### Misc
- Everybody has a peoplespartyofcanada.ca Email address
- EDA sub-sites for NationBuilder (if possible)
