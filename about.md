Welcome to my new and improved site. 
I am in the process of showcasing my work, here. 
For expediency, I am adding my smaller projects, first. 
One reason for this is that the bulk of my work has been on proprietary 
systems, and I am unable to disclose much of my work, BUT, I do have 
a few pet projects and side projects that can be shared. Again, the 
bigger ones are closed source, and are in the process of being 
converted to open source.
